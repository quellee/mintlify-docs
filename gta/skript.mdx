<Info>
    What is the difference beetween those 2 version?

    GTA V Stealth is a way safer version to use, as it is not seen on Clip Programms like Nvidia GeForce, Discord Screen Transfers and Screenshots. 
    It has less riskier features and is **EXTERNAL**, which means it is not directly in your game. 
    The other version is the Normal Version which is **INTERNAL**, so it will be seen on Nvidia GeForce and other Clip Programms.
</Info>

<Tip>
    After injecting the cheat, you can use the cheat menu by pressing the `INSERT` key.
